"""
Module for Rate Coding implementation.

This module implements the rate coding scheme described in
"Neural Coding in Spiking Neural Networks: A Comparative Study for Robust Neuromorphic Systems" by Guo et al.
The rate coding scheme converts each input pixel into a Poisson spike train.
Input pixels are scaled down by a factor (λ) to produce firing rates confined between 0 and 63.75 Hz.

Usage:
    Import the RateCoding class in your main script:
        from rate_coding import RateCoding
    Create an instance:
        coder = RateCoding(scaling_factor=4, dt=0.001, duration=0.1)
    Encode an image:
        spike_train = coder.encode(image)
"""

import numpy as np


class RateCoding:
    """
    Class for implementing rate coding for input image encoding.

    Attributes:
        scaling_factor (float): Factor to scale down pixel intensities. Default is 4.
        dt (float): Time step in seconds. Default is 0.001 (1 ms).
        duration (float): Duration of the simulation window in seconds. Default is 0.1 (100 ms).
        num_steps (int): Total number of simulation time steps.

    def __init__(self, scaling_factor=4, dt=0.001, duration=0.1):

        Parameters:
            scaling_factor (float): Scaling factor λ for pixel intensities.
            dt (float): Time step in seconds.

        Encode an input image into a Poisson spike train using rate coding.

        The input image is expected to be a 2D NumPy array with pixel intensities in the range [0, 255].
        Each pixel is scaled down by the scaling factor to obtain a firing rate in Hz.
        A Poisson spike train is generated for each pixel by comparing the firing rate-derived probability with random numbers.

        Parameters:
            image (numpy.ndarray): 2D array representing the input image.

        Returns:
