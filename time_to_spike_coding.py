Module for Time-to-First-Spike (TTFS) Coding.

This module implements the TTFS coding scheme described in:
"Neural Coding in Spiking Neural Networks: A Comparative Study for Robust Neuromorphic Systems" by Guo et al.

Time-to-First-Spike (TTFS) Coding:
----------------------------------
1. Normalize each pixel by dividing by the maximum (e.g., 255 for 8-bit images).
2. At discrete simulation step i, the continuous time is t = i * dt (seconds).
3. Compute threshold:
       P_th(t) = theta0 * exp(-t / tau_th) - given in the paper
   where tau_th is the time constant in seconds, theta0 ~ 1.0 by default as mentioned in the paper.
4. A pixel fires its first spike at step i if:
       pixel_value_norm > P_th(i)
   After firing once, that pixel is inhibited (no further spikes).

Usage Example:
    from ttfs_coding import TTFSCoding
    coder = TTFSCoding(dt=0.001, duration=0.02, tau_th=0.006, theta0=1.0)
    spike_train = coder.encode(image)

        tau_th (float): Time constant in seconds for exponential threshold decay.

        Encode a 2D image into a TTFS spike train.

        1. Normalize the image to [0, 1].
        2. For each time step i, compute the threshold P_th(i) = theta0 * exp(-(i*dt)/tau_th).
        3. Any pixel whose normalized intensity > P_th(i) fires a spike (if it has not fired before).

        Parameters:
            image (numpy.ndarray): 2D array of pixel intensities (e.g., shape [H, W], range [0..255]).

        Returns:
            numpy.ndarray of shape (H, W, num_steps), with boolean entries indicating spike occurrences.
            Typically, each pixel will fire at most once (True at exactly one time step).
